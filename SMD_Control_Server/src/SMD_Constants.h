/** \mainpage SMDServer Commands
 *	\section Introduction
 *		The goal of this software is to support all of the commands listed in the AMCI manual for the SMD series motors. Those commands are documented in the AMCI
 *		[SMD user manual](http://www.amci.com/stepper-motor-control/integrated-stepper-motor-control-smd23e.asp).
 *	
 *		If you haven't already done so, you __really__ need to read README.md in the root directory. Dependencies, limitations, and other important info are all
 *		contained in this file.
 *		
 *		Comments, suggestions, bugs, etc. should all be directed to [jd@pauldavisautomation.com](jd@pauldavisautomation.com)
 *
 *	\section Commands
 *		All of these commands are used while connected to the server using `telnet` or some other terminal emulation program. 
 *
 *		If you get unexplained errors, you
 *		may want to run SMDServer in verbose (debug) mode: `SMDServer -v`
 *
 *	\subsection connect
 *	Command format is as so (replace IP address with the SMD IP address):
 *
 *	`connect,10.0.6.50`
 *
 *	If successful, server responds with `SMD_CONNECT_SUCCESS`
 *
 *
 *	\subsection disconnect
 *	Command format is as follows (no IP address required):
 *
 *	`disconnect`
 *
 *	No response is given by the server. The network light on the SMD should stop blinking at this time.
 *
 *
 *	\subsection driveEnable
 *	Command format is as follows:
 *
 *	`driveEnable`
 *
 *	If successful, server responds with `ENABLE_SUCCESS`
 *
 *

 *
 *	If successful, server responds with `COMMAND_SUCCESS`
 *
 *	\subsection relativeMove
 *	Moves the motor a specified number steps, following a trapezoidal move profile. The motor does __not__ need to be homed.
 *
 *	The format of the command is as follows:
 *

 *	\subsection holdMove
 *	Stops motion using the deceleration value specified in the active move profile. The drive will __not__ register a *Position Invalid* error.
 *
 *	The format of the command is as follows:
 *
 *	`holdMove`
 *
 *	If successful, server responds with `COMMAND_SUCCESS`
 *
 *	\subsection immedStop
 *	Stops motion using a hard stop with no deceleration. The drive __will__ register a *Position Invalid* error and will need to be re-homed.
 *
 *	The format of the command is as follows:
 *
 *	`immedStop`
 *
 *	If successful, server responds with `COMMAND_SUCCESS`
 *
 *	\subsection resetErrors

 *
 *	The format of this command is:
 *
 *	`resetErrors`
 *
 *	If successful, server responds with `RESET_ERRORS_SUCCESS`
 *
 *	\subsection readInputRegisters
 *	Command to read input registers, outputs registers back to client in format 0x0, 0x0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.
 *
 *	The format of the input registers follows the byte order as specified in the user manual section titled *Input Registers*. That is, the left most 0x0
 *	above is word 0.
 *
 *	The format of this command is:
 *
 *	`readInputRegisters`
 *
 *
 *	\subsection presetMotorPosition
 *	Command that presets the motor position (motor counts) to a specified value.
 *
 *	The format of the command is as follows:
 *
 *	`presetMotorPosition,pos`
 *	
 *	The following limits apply:
 *
 *		*pos* must be an integer between -8,388,607 and +8,388,607
 *
 *	If successful, server responds with `PRESET_POSITION_SUCCESS`
 *
 *	\subsection presetEncoderPosition
 *	Command that presets the encoder position to a specified value.
 *
 *	The format of the command is as follows:
 *
 *	`presetEncoderPosition,pos`
 *
 *	If successful, server responds with `PRESET_ENCODER_SUCCESS`
 *
 *	The following limits apply:
 *
 *		*pos* must be an integer between -8,388,607 and +8,388,607
 *
 *	\subsection Configuration (loadCurrentConfiguration, readCurrentConfiguration, saveConfig)
 *	Configuration is a bit of a tricky item with these drives. You really need to read the user manual and understand how the drive interprets the "configuration mode"
 *	bit in the Command Word or else you are going to run into problems with annoying errors and the like. Also, you will want to learn the difference between writing
 *	the configuration to the onboard flash versus just loading it into memory.
 *
 *	When wrapping a GUI around this process, you will have to make sure to give the drive ample time to flip bits and process the information.
 *
 *	In general though, the operation goes something like this (in order of operations from the client to the server):
 *
 *	1. Execute `loadCurrentConfiguration` to put the drive into Configuration Mode and load the input registers with the current configuration.
 *	2. Execute `readCurrentConfiguration` which will echo the current configuration to the client terminal using a similar format as the input (status) registers.
 *	3. Optionally, use saveConfig to send a configuration back to the SMD.
 *	4. To put the drive back into Command Mode, use `resetErrors` or `driveEnable` to flip the appropriate bits.
 *
 *	\subsection loadCurrentConfiguration
 *	See above for explanation.
 *
 *	The format of the command is as follows:
 *
 *	`loadCurrentConfiguration`
 *
 *	If successful, server responds with `READY_TO_READ_CONFIG`
 *
 *	\subsection readCurrentConfiguration
 *	See above (point 2) for explanation. The return format of the config input registers is as follows:
 *
 *	`###0x0,0x0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`
 *
 *	Similar to the status input registers, this format is in the same order as the registers in the user manual (the leftmost word is Config Word 0)
 *
 *
 *	\subsection saveConfig
 *	Saves a configuration specified by the following command string to the drive:
 *
 *	`saveConfig,control_word,config_word,motor_starting_speed,motor_steps_per_turn,encoder_pulses_per_turn,idle_current_percentage,motor_current`
 *	
 *		*control_word* is a decimal representation of the Control Word as outlined in the SMD user manual
 *		*config_word* is a decimal representation of the Config Word as outlined in the SMD user manual
 *		*motor_starting_speed is a positive integer between 1 and 1999999
 *		*motor_steps_per_turn* is a positive integer between 200 and 32767
 *		*encoder_pulses_per_turn* is 1024
 *		*idle_current_percentage* is an integer between 1 and 100, representing 1% of total motor current to 100% of 3.4A.
 *		*motor_current* is a value between 1 and 34, representing 1.0A to 3.4A
 *
 *
 *	\subsection homeCW
 *	Executes a predefined homing routine where the motor jogs clockwise at the specified speed until seeing the Home Limit input close.
 *	
 *	The format of the command is as follows:
 *
 *	`homeCW,speed,accel,decel,jerk`
 *
 *		*speed* is an integer between 1 and 2999999
 *		*accel* is an integer between 1 and 5000
 *		*decel* is an integer between 1 and 5000
 *		*jerk* is an integer between 1 and 5000
 *
 *	\subsection homeCCW
 *	Executes a predefined homing routine where the motor jogs counter clockwise at the specified speed until seeing the Home Limit input close.
 *
 *	The format of the command is as follows:
 *
 *	`homeCCW,speed,accel,decel,jerk`
 *
 *		*speed* is an integer between 1 and 2999999
 *		*accel* is an integer between 1 and 5000
 *		*decel* is an integer between 1 and 5000
 *		*jerk* is an integer between 1 and 5000
 *
 *
 *
 *	\subsection programAssembledMove
 *	You will definitely want to home the motor prior to trying an assembled move. 
 *
 *	Once homed, you upload the move profile to the drive using the following command:
 *	
 *	`programAssembledMove,move_json`
 *
 *	*move_json* is a JSON string with the following format:
 *
 *		{
 *
 *			"segment": {
 *				"target_pos_inches": 5200,
 *				"programmed_speed": 1000,
 *				"accel": 150,
 *				"decel": 150,
 *				"jerk": 0
 *			},
 *			"segment": {
 *				"target_pos_inches": 5200,
 *				"programmed_speed": 2000,
 *				"accel": 150,
 *				"decel": 150,
 *				"jerk": 0
 *			},
 *			"segment": {
 *				"target_pos_inches": 5200,
 *				"programmed_speed": 4000,
 *				"accel": 150,
 *				"decel": 150,
 *				"jerk": 0
 *			}
 *		}
 *
 *	An assembled move profile can have up to __16__ segments. 
 *
 *	It does take some time for the move to program, so be patient. Each move segment takes ~2 seconds.
 *
 *	When the profile is successfully accepted, the server responds with `ASSEMBLED_MOVE_ACCEPTED` to the client.
 *
 *	\subsection runAssembledDwellMove
 *	Once a move profile is loaded using `programAssembledMove`, it can be executed with either `runAssembledDwellMove` or `runAssembledBlendMove`.
 *
 *	If the motor __changes direction__, you __MUST__ use a dwell move! The dwell allows the motor to decel and then change directions.
 *
 *	This format for this command is `runAssembledDwellMove,dwell_time`.
 *
 *		*dwell_time* is the time, in milliseconds (ms) that the drive should wait between move segments
 *
 *	\subsection runAssembledBlendMove
 *	Once a move profile is loaded using `programAssembledMove`, it can be executed with either `runAssembledDwellMove` or `runAssembledBlendMove`.
 *
 *	If the motor __changes direction__, you __MUST__ use a dwell move! The dwell allows the motor to decel and then change directions.
 *	There is no delay between segments in a blend move.
 *
 *	This format for this command is `runAssembledBlendMove,direction`.
 *
 *		*direction* is the motor rotation direction - 0 is CW, 1, CCW
 *
 *
 *	\subsection startManualMode
 *	Used to enable manual control mode. Beta, and undocumented. If you want to do analog control over the network, you are good enough to read the source.
 *	I originally used this as a demo using an Arduino Yun. Check out the Arduino file in this repository for an idea of what is going on. Then, read the C source.
 *
 *	\subsection stopManualMode
 *	See above. There be dragons here.
