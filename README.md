# SMD_Control_Server
## An elegant and speedy cross platform motion controller for [AMCI](www.amci.com) SMD series stepper motors.

Designed as a portable motion controller for AMCI SMD series integrated stepper motors and networked drives, SMD_Control_Server (SMDCS) is a socket-based motion control server that follows a handful of rules:

1. Be fast - SMDCS is written in C, so it is fast and small and can be used on a number of hosts.
2. Be portable - Written using portable ANSI (ish) C, SMDCS has minimal external dependencies, and should compile on all hosts.
3. Be easy to integrate - SMDCS uses a socket interface and takes simple text commands. Control SMD motors with anything from telnet to a snazzy iOS mobile client.

More information on AMCI SMD series steppers may be found on [AMCI's website](http://www.amci.com/stepper-motor-control/integrated-stepper-motor-control-smd23e.asp)

Limitations
------
As of right now, SMDCS works only using Modbus/TCP. If you are willing to help out by reversing Ethernet/IP and contributing to a stack, let me know.

Also, SMDCS only supports the non-DLR (Device Level Ring) AMCI SMD motors. The Modbus implementation on the DLR motors is non-compatible with *libmodbus*. AMCI is working on it...

SMDCS only supports one client connection at a time. One motion controller == one axis of motion. If you want to run multiple axes of motion from one machine, spawn however many SMDCS processes you would like all on different ports.

Feedback
------
This is a labor of love (and insanity). If you have questions, comments, concerns, bugs, rants, etc. please post a bug or start a discussion. Alternatively, you can contact me privately and I will definitely respond.

Dependencies
------
[libmodbus](https://github.com/stephane/libmodbus)

[cJSON](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON)

A C compiler (GCC is probably your best bet, honestly)

Setup and Installation
------

### Software
1. Clone the cJSON Git repository into a directory where you can build the library. For this purpose, you will be installing cJSON as a shared library.

Once inside of the cJSON directory, execute the following commands (they will build the library and install it into /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/include/cjson):

```
# make all
# sudo make install
```

2. Install *libmodbus*.

Similar to cJSON, you will need to download the libmodbus source code, extract it, enter the directory, and execute the following commands:

```
# ./configure
# sudo make install
```

3. In the *SMD_Server/SMD_Server* directory, execute the following commands:

```
# ./configure
# make
# sudo make install
```

4. Your executable is at */usr/local/bin/smd_server*.

5. Optional - build documentation. This program comes with built-in documentation generated by Doxygen. If you would like to use it, you will have to first install
Doxygen, and then use Doxygen to build the documentation:

```
# sudo apt-get install doxygen
# cd docs/
# doxygen Doxyfile
```

Once the build is complete, there should be a newly created "docs" directory in the docs directory. Just open *docs/html/index.html*, and you can view the documentation tree.
 

### AMCI Motor
1. READ THE [MANUAL](http://www.amci.com/pdfs/integrated-stepper-control/smd-series-ethernet-integrated-stepper-motor-drives.pdf), paying special attention to the pinout diagrams. The SMD power connector is **NOT** protected against reversed wiring.
2. Download the [AMCI NetConfigurator software](http://www.amci.com/configuration-software/amci-net-configurator.zip) and configure your motor's IP address. Do not forget to set the motor to **Modbus/TCP**!!
3. Configure your motor in the configuration screen to fit your application.
4. Power cycle the motor.

Creating Motion
------
BEFORE DOING ANYTHING - READ THE DOCUMENTATION at `docs/html/index.html`.

First and foremost, you will want to start SMDCS. Navigate to where the compiled binary is stored (typically at *src/SMDControl*), and execute the following the launch the daemon:

```bash
# must be root (or use sudo) to run SMDServer

# if you want to see console output, specify -v
$ sudo src/SMDServer -v

# if you want to run as a daemon, specify -d
$ sudo src/SMDServer -d

# if you want to specify the port, use -p (default is port 7000)
$ sudo src/SMDServer -v -p 4242
```

Assuming your motor is hooked-up and configured as recommended before, you should be able to telnet to your server and start issuing commands. Some examples would be:

```bash
#assuming your motor IP address is 10.20.6.50

$ telnet localhost 7000
connect,10.20.6.50
SMD_CONNECT_SUCCESS
resetErrors
COMMAND_SUCCESS
jogCW,250,250,0,5000 # jog clockwise with 250 accel, 250 decel, 0 jerk, and 5000 steps/rev velocity
COMMAND_SUCCESS
holdMove # stops the move
COMMAND_SUCCESS
disconnect
```

Of course, full documentation may be found in *docs/html*. I **highly** recommend browsing the docs, as they will provide all of the motion commands available!
